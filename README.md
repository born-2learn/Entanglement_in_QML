## Project Description

Classical neural networks encode higher dimensional vectors(inputs) to lower dimensional vectors(outputs), but the reverse is not possible. Recent researches have shown that scrambling of information form a small subsystem to a larger one is feasible. In our QOSF project, we analyse the effect of entanglement as a variational circuit trains and also study the role of various entropies to characterize entanglement.

## Running the notebooks

1. Create a virtual environment:

	```
	$ python3 -m venv venv
	```

2. Activate the environment:

	```
	$ source venv/bin/activate
	```

3. Update `pip`:

	```
	$ pip install --upgrade pip
	```
4. Clone the repo

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/born-2learn/Entanglement_in_QML.git
    ```
5. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

	```
	$ jupyter notebook
	```

6. Open and run the jupyter notebooks
